This Kodi addon script will parse gamelist files in Batocera Linux's roms directory for favorites and display them in a widget.

Currently, this only works with versions of Kodi installed within Batocera. I may add support for other EmulationStation-based gaming platforms if there is interest.

As this is an early alpha and I'm not a skilled developer please open issues for any bugs or suggestions with as much information as you can. Please also attach your kodi.log if possible.

#### To-do:

- Add support for additional search patterns like "latest games" etc..
- Add other languages.
- Add support for more ES-based platforms.
- Tidy the code.
- Commission a major Hollywood movie based on the creation of this plugin starring Aiden Turner.
