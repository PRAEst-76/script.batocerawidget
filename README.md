This [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) addon script will parse gamelist files in Batocera Linux's roms directory for favorites and display them in a widget.

This addon is primarily designed for use with [Batocera](https://batocera.org/) but may work with [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) and similar EmulationStation-based distros. rom/gamelist directory is customaisable n the settings.

As this is a beta and I'm not a skilled developer please open issues for any bugs or suggestions with as much information as you can. Please also attach your [kodi.log](https://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file) if possible.
